Testing Structure (New)
These prompts test the new "Strict Architectural Rules" and "Floor Slabs":

"Two storey modern house" -> Forces exactly 2 floors (6.4m height) with visible floor separation.
"Three storey office building" -> Creates a tall 3-floor structure with aligned windows.
"Tall double decker home" -> Also triggers the 2-storey logic.
📐 Testing Complex Shapes
These prompts trigger the L-Shaped compound footprint logic:

"Large modern villa" -> "Villa" is a keyword that triggers the L-shape wing.
"L-shaped brick estate" -> Explicitly asks for the shape.
"Sprawling ranch complex" -> "Complex" and "Ranch" also trigger the compound layout.
🎨 Testing Styles & Materials
"Classic brick cottage with gable roof" -> Triggers: Brick material, pitched roof, arched windows (if classic), and chimney-style aesthetics.
"Minimalist concrete box" -> Triggers: Modern style, flat roof, floor-to-ceiling windows.
"Traditional timber home" -> Triggers: Wood material, standard windows, classic door.
🖼️ Testing Details
"Modern glass home with forest surroundings" -> Triggers: "Forest" environment (darker ground, different ambience).
"Industrial stone warehouse" -> Triggers: Stone material, industrial door style.
